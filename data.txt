8/24/16, 6:59 PM - ‪+91 94030 52074‬: Whatever it is, I suppose it's not going to be very easy as Sharath mentioned about students from previous batch failing in it. Also, being a prerequisite for two courses, it must be worth taking it. Besides I don't see many interesting courses available to fill the bucket of 10.

8/24/16, 11:39 PM - Shagun: I bought and I paid the tax but apparently if you pay through your Su card, someone said, like the food and other merchandise on campus, the laptop also might be bought tax free
8/24/16, 11:40 PM - ‪+1 (315) 949-8857‬: my laptop at sustore had 8 % tax
8/24/16, 11:41 PM - Shagun: Exactly! mine too
But did you make the payment with your Su card or credit/debit/cash  ?
8/24/16, 11:42 PM - Manjunath: so, from the vending machine or SU campus food stores, you can buy stuff via university student ID card.
Just go to myslice and recharge your student id for like $50.
it will be billed to your bursar account.

You can use your student ID in so many places on campus and no tax will be charged.
8/24/16, 11:43 PM - Shagun: So no idea if there is a possibility for a tax free laptop at the Su bookstore?
8/24/16, 11:44 PM - Manjunath: i'm not sure.
I can check my receipt and let you know in sometime.

or just call up the bookstore, they'll let you know the tax free limit on the SU card

by the one and only Manjunath 🔫💣🛡⚔
Come join an exciting live talk and demo of the Wolfram Alpha Language this Thursday in the ICE Box, hosted by NEXIS and the Blackstone Launch Pad. Manjunath Babu will be showing how this language is used in the Wolfram Programming Lab, and some of these skills will even translate to the MLB Challenge! There will be a live coding demo besides the informational talk and you'll be able to learn a bit about what we do at Blackstone. 

 

The event is from 6pm to 7pm in the ICE Box on Thursday, November 3rd. For more information about the event, check out the flyer attached and send any questions you might have to the program manager, Braden Croy, at pbcroy@syr.edu.

Introducing AaaS *(Alcohol as a Service)*🥃

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/yourstory.com/2017/03/hipbar-startup/amp/

HipBar, allows liquor connoisseurs to buy full bottles of their favourite booze and later redeem it in any restaurant or hotel across the country. 

For example, if the connoisseur buys a bottle of expensive whisky for Rs 5,000, he can consume even a small portion of, say, 30 ml in any bar. The hotel or bar will then charge the connoisseur for the portion, which will be paid through the app. 

The app will immediately reflect a reduction in the volume of the bottle. The bottle of whisky that was purchased will stand as a prepaid instrument and its value will diminish as the customer opts to consume the whisky later on."
